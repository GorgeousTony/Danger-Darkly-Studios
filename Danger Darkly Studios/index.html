	<h2>A Better Breed of Games.</h2>
	
	<p>Have you ever stepped outside of your door, looked around, and realized just how much is out there? How many places to explore, mysteries to investigate, and strange sights to behold? We believe that this is where the magic of a video game comes from; the ability to step into another world, full of possibilities and wonder. We want to take that magic and bring it to the fore. We don't just make games; we make worlds. Come play in ours.</p>
